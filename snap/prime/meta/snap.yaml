summary: Shenko.org is a open source community check us out on youtube
description: 'Welcome to shenko, our goal when creating this community is to write
  software and build hardware using open source tools. We wanted to write the entire
  project in python as this is a programming language best suited for learning. Blender
  is a 3d software that allows us to create game assets and upload to the shenko website
  to share or import into the Panda3d game environment (that also uses python) and
  build the most epic 3d community.
